# TETRIS

This code contains the operation of a basic **tetris**.

It has 6 different figures that appear in random order. The six figures are classified as follows:

   - L: It has 4 rotations. 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees
   - J: It has 4 rotations. 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees
   - T: It has 4 rotations. 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees
   - Z: It has 2 rotations. 0 and 90 degrees
   - S: It has 2 rotations. 0 and 90 degrees
   - I: It has 2 rotations. 0 and 90 degrees
   - O: It has a rotation. 0 degrees

##### 1. Rotations are effective using the up arrow key. ⬆️
##### 2. Move from side to side with the right arrow and left arrow keys. ⬅️➡️
##### 3. Accelerate the figure's fall with the down arrow key. ⬇️
